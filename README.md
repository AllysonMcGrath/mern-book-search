# Book Search Engine-MERN, GraphQL, Apollo Server

## Description

The purpose of this project was to refactor a Google Books search application to change it from using RESTful API to using GraphQL API with Apollo Server. This mean creating typeDefs and resolvers, and creating queries and mutations. An Apollo Provider was also added so that requests work with the Apollo Server.

The application allows a user to create an account and log in. They can search for books, and then save books to a list. They can also remove books from the their saved list.
